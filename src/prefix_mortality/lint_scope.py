"""The scope sentence appears exactly once in README.md, verbatim, and no sentence anywhere in
README/ledger/docs paraphrases it. Heuristic for paraphrase: a sentence whose distinctive vocabulary
overlaps heavily with the scope sentence's, and that is not the verbatim sentence itself, is flagged.

Copied from lag-ladder `src/lag_ladder/lint_scope.py`, itself adapted from linear-ceiling
`src/linear_ceiling/lint_scope.py` (UPSTREAM.md provenance): the mechanism is verbatim; SCOPE_SENTENCE
and EXEMPT are this repo's. The threshold 0.45 was calibrated in linear-ceiling on two anchor cases;
this repo's tests re-anchor it on its own sentence (tests/test_lint_scope.py).
